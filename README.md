## Hi, I'm Adam ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer based in Sweden, and I'm passionate about crafting digital experiences. I strive while using both the logical and creative part of the brain. I feel most at home while constantly working in these roles as a front-end developer within a team. I stand for quality innovation and building useful products with a focus on the person who uses the product. I am a proactive, confident and communicative person who always looks ahead to the future.
